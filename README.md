# Numeric-Text-Detection
## Description
Numeric text detection in video analysis of a Synchronic Turbine Panel refers to the process of identifying and extracting numerical values from a video feed that displays information related to a synchronous turbine panel. This task involves using computer vision and image processing techniques to locate and recognize numeric text within each frame of the video. The extracted values can then be used for various purposes, such as monitoring and analyzing the performance of the turbine or generating data for further analysis and reporting.

## Python libraries that I used on the project
- OpenCV: Open Source Computer Vision Library, used for various computer vision tasks like image manipulation, object detection, and more.
- NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, often used for handling arrays and numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: A popular library for creating 2D plots and visualizations in Python.
- EasyOCR: A Python library for optical character recognition, making it easier to extract text from images and perform OCR tasks.

Here is an example of an output image from numeric number detection.
