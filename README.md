# Numeric-Text-Detection
Numeric text detection in video analysis of a Synchronic Turbine Panel refers to the process of identifying and extracting numerical values from a video feed that displays information related to a synchronous turbine panel. This task involves using computer vision and image processing techniques to locate and recognize numeric text within each frame of the video. The extracted values can then be used for various purposes, such as monitoring and analyzing the performance of the turbine or generating data for further analysis and reporting.

Here is an example of an output image from numeric number detection.
